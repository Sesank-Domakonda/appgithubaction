Github actions:
---------------
=>Github actions is a powerful automation tool provideed by GitHub that enables to automate tasks related to software devlopment workflows.
=>It allows for the creation of custom workflowss, which can be triggered by various events, such as push to a repository, pull requests or scheduled events.


Github actions - CI/CD rules
Github - Code repository
Git - versio control system.

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
-------------------------------------------------

CI: It is a practice where developers frequently merge their code changes into a shared repo. 
=>Each merge triggers an automated build and testing processs to ensure the changes do not break the existing functionality.

CD: CD extends the concepts of CI by automating the deployment of code to production environments after it passes all required tests.

            -----------
Local----->|Github Repo|--------> |Dev|----->|QA|--------->|UAT|---------->|Production Environment|

=>Workflows - Yaml
-------------------
=>A workflow is a series of steps, practices and tools that a developer follow to write, test collaborate on ,
and deploy code effectively.

=>This workflow is designed to stramline the SD process by reducting errors and producing high quality output.

Key Stages:
------------
1) Coding -> Ide version -> language (pythion, js)
2)Version control - GIT -> Manage the codebase.
 
3)Code Review
4)Testing (automated)
5)CI


Developer Workflow
------------------
=>Dev A 

1)feature Developement
---------------------

                        main branch        new branch (create development in local Environment)       
Task --------------->      

2)Push and Pull request(PR):
---------------------------
Ocne development is done then we push it to the Remote repository.
then we raise the pull request to merge the changes in the main branch.

The tram member Review the PR for code quality, styke and other issues.


3)Automated CI pipeline
----------------------
->Once a pull request is trigerred then CI pipeline is trigerred.
->This pipeline builds the application and runs all the test cases.
->If pipeline passes the Pipeline request is aproved and merged into the main branch.

4)Continuous Deployment
------------------------
->Once merging the PR, a  CD pipeline is trigerred
->The application is automatically deployed to Dev or staging environment.
